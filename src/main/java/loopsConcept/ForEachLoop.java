		//Why for each loop: it is recommended to use the Java for-each loop for traversing/navigating the elements of array and collection because it makes the code readable. Normally it uses with arrays and collections. It's very easy to use.
		//Unlike others loop, no need to write initialization, condition and increment

		//For (DataType eachCollections : Collection){
		//Statement (eachCollections);
		}

		//Syntax: (datatype String)
		//For (String eachName : names){
		//System.out.println(eachName);
		//}

		//Syntax: (datatype int)
		//for (int eachNum: numbers) {
		//System.out.println(eachNum);
		//}
		//How it works?
		//The Java for-each loop traverses/navigate the array or collection until the last element. For each element, it stores the element in the variable and executes the body of the for-each loop.
